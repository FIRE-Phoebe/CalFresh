# CalFresh Program Analysis
## Overview of CalFresh Program
CalFresh is a state-managed program in California (known nationwide as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program or SNAP) that provides low-income individuals and families with funds on an Electronic Benefit Transfer (EBT) card. These funds can be used to purchase food at authorized retail stores, grocery stores, and farmer's markets.

The program aims to help eligible households afford nutritious food and improve their overall health and well-being. The amount of benefits a household receives depends on factors such as income, household size, and expenses. Recipients can use the benefits to buy a variety of food items, including fruits, vegetables, meats, dairy products, and more.

CalFresh is administered by the California Department of Social Services (CDSS) and is funded by the federal government. Eligibility is determined based on income and certain expenses. Applicants can apply online, in person, or by mail through their local county social services office.

The program not only addresses immediate food needs but also strives to alleviate poverty and promote better nutrition among low-income individuals and families across California.
